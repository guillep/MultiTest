I represent a slave node with a given ID. A test case with this role will execute the tasks marked in the test case with its ID and work as a normal testcase (either with a success, failure or error) with a single exception: slaves ignore expected failures. This happens because it is the master's responsibility to decide whether the test case failed or not in an integral manner. Thus, since the slave cannot decide it by its own, it will ignore being an expected result and forward the failure to the master to decide.
